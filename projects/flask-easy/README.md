## Question description

Implement a REST API to manage events in an Event Ticketing System. The system should allow users to create events, retrieve events, purchase tickets, delete events, and get event details. Each event has key attributes, and the API will handle various operations related to event management.

Event Model

- `id`: The unique ID of the event (Integer)
- `name`: The name of the event (String)
- `date`: The event's date (dd-mm-yyyy format)
- `venue`: The event's location (String)
- `available_tickets`: Number of tickets available (Integer)
- `price`: Price of a single ticket (Float)

### Example of an Event JSON object:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Music Concert",
  "date": "15-10-2024",
  "venue": "City Arena",
  "available_tickets": 100,
  "price": 50.00
}
```
